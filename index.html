            <h3>Why the Barbie Movie?</h3>
            <h2>Why Barbie is A Movie Everyone Needs to See!</h2>
            <p>
              Barbie is so much more than a visually stunning movie filled with
              bright colors, incredible costumes, and pop style. It is
              completely unafraid to dive into the way that women (and men, too)
              are treated in the real world. Life isnâ€™t all fun and games. It
              just isnâ€™t. Greta Gerwig takes her talent a writer and director
              and dumps it into this film. The cast is perfectly chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only does this movie deliver a heartfelt story that will put
              viewers through a therapy session while simultaneously causing
              them to crack up, it also details the history of Barbie. Talk
              about nostalgia, there are a whole lot of references to Barbies of
              the past in this movie. If you are a Barbie fan, chances are you
              will see your favorite doll in this movie.
